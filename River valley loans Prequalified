Hereâ€™s how a typical payday loan works:

You want to borrow $500. The lender offers you a two-week loan. The fee is $15 for every $100 you borrow. So your fee will be $75. ($15 x 5 = $75).
You give the lender a check for $575, or you authorize the lender to electronically debit your bank account. The lender gives you $500 in cash.
Two weeks later, you owe the lender $575. The lender will either debit your bank account, cash your check, or take cash or another form of payment from you, depending on how you agreed to repay the loan.
The bottom line: You paid $75 to borrow $500 for two weeks.
